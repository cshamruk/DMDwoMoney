Computation of the value function for the main discrete time model in the article by Yingni Guo and Johannes Horner "Dynamic Mechanism Design Without Money" 

Numerical solution for the optimal dynamic allocation among agents with non-verifiable needs and in absence of payment mechanisms (e.g. repeated allocation of anti-poverty programs among neighborhoods self-reporting their needs).
